# Ideas on how to make the game

## Ideas from our hike on March 2, 2023:

So, we were thinking of having a big central region of plains, surrounded by mountains on 3 sides, and the coast on the 4th side. The plains area would be somewhat Kansas themed in various ways.
Thoughts on Story:
We were thinking of having the beginning of the story have you start out in magic college, where you would learn the basics but also get a chance to start developing your build while getting tutored on some eventual spells you might get access to with certain combinations. After that, you'd graduate from mage college and be let loose on the world. We were thinking of basing the story on the idea of eventually settling down to help out a particular community, and then occasionally travelling around to do various tasks. Alternatively, you could also just keep wandering around, but I think it'd be good to restrict the choice to either setting in ONE community or not settling down. We haven't thought of a good way to balance settling in one community versus freely travelling the world. My influences for some of this was taken from the Book of the Dead webnovel and the Pokemon Ranger: Shadows of Almia game.
Thoughts on Combat:
In terms of combat, we discussed having things be somewhat GURPS-styled in some ways, with some spells taking so long that they'd be very difficult to ever use in combat. In addition, instead of each turn letting you do whatever you want in the span of one turn, every action would take a different amount of time, and whoever finishes their action first will go next. This means that you could theoretically cast any spell in combat or perform any action, but it would be really difficult. This kind of combat is intended to be kinda involved, so it would be important to limit how many encounters you do, or maybe make it so grinding is very unnecessary. Alternatively, we could also add tools to automate certain actions, so you could set up an automatic strategy for certain combat scenarios, and then just watch them play out.
